## Prerequisites
All the necessary python libraries are written in the requires.txt. 

Make sure to have the necessary compiler in your environment, as it contains i.e. paramiko. Alternatively use wheel files.
Also listed are the ipython[notebook] dependencies, which are not essential to the project.

boto3 is also used (Python Amazon API). Make sure to properly configure your credentials and config.. see AWS CLI Setup..
